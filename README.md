# Contribution Note

This project includes a custom JavaScript file, `assets/currency-converter.js`, which I contributed to enhance the storefront's currency handling. My work on this file enables the following features:

- **Automatic User Country Detection:** Uses IP geolocation to determine the user's country and cache the result for performance.
- **Dynamic Currency Conversion:** Converts and displays product prices based on the user's location and Shopify's supported currencies.
- **Seamless Integration:** Updates all price elements on the page in real-time, including when the DOM changes or the user switches currencies.
- **Shopify Compatibility:** Leverages Shopify's global objects and settings for accurate and consistent currency formatting.

This contribution improves the shopping experience for international customers by ensuring prices are always shown in the most relevant currency.

Thank you for making this Shopify theme better! Your contributions make a difference. ‚ú®
